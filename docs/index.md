# **Salvanian**

## **Cases**

Salvanian has six regular cases that not only have regular endings (with only two forms based on whether or not the word ends with a consonant or with a vowel) but also regular usages. They are as follows:



**Case** | **Name is Salvanian** | **Ending**
-----|-------|---------
Nominative | *Unchanged* | *a'peci*
Accusative | *i/ti* | *a'gyitas*
Dative | *og/gyo* | *a'dagyo*
Prepositional | *e/te* | *a'hete*
Allative | *ak/ka* | *a'ijkozak*
Ablative | *af/fa* | *a'ijkozaf*

As you can see, there are two forms of each case. This is the case because (as I have mentioned before) different forms are used based solely on whether or not a noun ends with a vowel or a consonant.

1) If a noun ends with a consonant
    * use the form that starts with a vowel.
    
2) If a noun ends with a vowel
    * use the form that starts with a consonant.

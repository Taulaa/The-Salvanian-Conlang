# **Salvanian**

## **Cases**

Salvanian has eighteen regular cases that not only have regular endings (with only two forms based on whether or not the word ends with a consonant or with a vowel) but also regular usages. They are as follows:



**Case** | **Ending** | **Name in Salvanian**
---------|------------|----------------------
Nominative | *an/n* | *a pecico*
Accusative | *i/ti* | *a gyitasoc*
Intransitive | *y/dy* | *a sypecico*
Dative | *og/gyo* | *a dagyoco*
Instructive | *ot/to* | *ag haitoco*
Genitive | *oc/co* | *a gyaco*
Essive | *ec/c* | *a gyico*
Abessive | *a/da* | *a daco*
Comitative | *u/su* | *ag haico*
Partitive | *uj/ju* | *a faco*
Vocative | *en/ne* | *ag etisoc*
Adessive | *e/ce* | *ag heteco*
Illative | *at/ta* | *a pelcico*
Inessive | *o/jo* | *a cico*
Elative | *et/te* | *a dancico*
Translative | *el/de* | *a peloco*
Exessive | *ul/du* | *a danoco*
Allative | *ak/ka* | *ag igyozakoc*
Ablative | *af/fa* | *ag igyozafoc*

As you can see, there are two forms of each case. This is because (as I have mentioned before) different forms are used based solely on whether or not a noun ends with a vowel or a consonant.

1. If a noun ends with a consonant, use the form that starts with a vowel.
    
2. If a noun ends with a vowel, use the form that starts with a consonant.

Here is a table for vocabulary with which I will explain the cases:

A/Ag = Definite article. No other articles exist in Salvanian.

Ky = Placed between objects in a list or between adjectives that don't describe anything but the original noun. *Eten kiaco ky hoico.* (*He is good and kind*)

Hait = And, in two simultaneously true statements, both including a verb. For example *Eten kiaco hait kin hoico*. (*He is good and I am kind.*) 

### The Nominative Case:

The Nominative case makes the word it changes the subject of the sentence. This along with the **accusative** case means sentence structure is fluid. The main rule is that words that describe an object or action come after it in a phrase.

If a word ends in a vowel, "*n*" is added.

If a word ends in a consonant, "*an*" is added.

Examples will be given after the explanation of the Accusative case in Salvanian.

### The Accusative Case:

The Accusative case makes the word it changes the direct object of the sentence. This means it is the noun that the action is done to. EG: "The man ate the cake." The cake is the direct object and would be marked.

If a word ends in a vowel, "*ti*" is added.

If a word ends in a consonant, "*i*" is added.

#### ***Nominative and Accusative Examples:***

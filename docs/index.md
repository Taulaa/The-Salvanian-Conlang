# **Salvanian**

## **Cases**

Salvanian has eleven regular cases that not only have regular endings (with only two forms based on whether or not the word ends with a consonant or with a vowel) but also regular usages. They are as follows:



**Case** | **Ending** | **Name in Salvanian**
---------|------------|----------------------
Nominative | *an/n* | *a'pecico*
Accusative | *i/ti* | *a'gyitasoc*
Dative | *og/gyo* | *a'dagyoco*
Instrumental | *ot/to* | *a'haitoco*
Genitive | *oc/co* | *a'gyaco*
Abessive | *a/da* | *a'daco*
Comitative | *u/su* | *a'haico*
Vocative | *en/ne* | *a'etisoc*
Locative | *e/te* | *a'heteco*
Allative | *ak/ka* | *a'ikjozakoc*
Ablative | *af/fa* | *a'ikjozafoc*

As you can see, there are two forms of each case. This is because (as I have mentioned before) different forms are used based solely on whether or not a noun ends with a vowel or a consonant.

1. If a noun ends with a consonant, use the form that starts with a vowel.
    
2. If a noun ends with a vowel, use the form that starts with a consonant.

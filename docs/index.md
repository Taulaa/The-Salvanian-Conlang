# **Salvanian**

## **Cases**

Salvanian has eighteen regular cases that not only have regular endings (with only two forms based on whether or not the word ends with a consonant or with a vowel) but also regular usages. They are as follows:



**Case** | **Ending** | **Name in Salvanian**
---------|------------|----------------------
Nominative | *an/n* | *a pecico*
Accusative | *i/ti* | *a gyitasoc*
Dative | *og/gyo* | *a dagyoco*
Instrumental | *ot/to* | *ag haitoco*
Genitive | *oc/co* | *a gyaco*
Essive | *ec/c* | *a gyico*
Abessive | *a/da* | *a daco*
Comitative | *u/su* | *ag haico*
Partitive | *uj/ju* | *a faco*
Vocative | *en/ne* | *ag etisoc*
Adessive | *e/ce* | *ag heteco*
Illative | *at/ta* | *a pelcico*
Inessive | *o/jo* | *a cico*
Elative | *et/te* | *a dancico*
Translative | *el/de* | *a peloco*
Exessive | *ul/du* | *a danoco*
Allative | *ak/ka* | *ag ikjozakoc*
Ablative | *af/fa* | *ag ikjozafoc*

As you can see, there are two forms of each case. This is because (as I have mentioned before) different forms are used based solely on whether or not a noun ends with a vowel or a consonant.

1. If a noun ends with a consonant, use the form that starts with a vowel.
    
2. If a noun ends with a vowel, use the form that starts with a consonant.

Here is a table for vocabulary with witch I will explain the cases:

A/Ag = Definite article. No other articles exist in Salvanian.


### The Nominative case:

The Nominative case makes the word it changes the subject of the sentence. This along with the **accusative** case means sentence structure is fluid. The main rule is that words that describe an object or action come after it in a phrase.

If a word ends in a vowel, "*n*" is added.

If a word ends in a consonant, "*an*" is added.

Examples will be given after the explanation of the Accusative case in Salvanian.


### The Accusative case:

The Accusative case makes the word it changes the direct object of the sentence. This means it is the noun that the action is done to. EG: "The man ate the cake." The cake is the direct object and would be marked.

If a word ends in a vowel, "*ti*" is added.

If a word ends in a consonant, "*i*" is added.

#### ***Nominative and Accusative examples:***

*Kin mhanes apit. = I drink tea.*

*Apit kin mhanes. = I drink tea.*

*Mhanes apit kin. = I drink tea.*

etc...


### The Dative case:

The Dative case in Salvanian shows recipients of objects.

If a word ends in a vowel, "*gyo*" is added.

If a word ends in a consonant, "*og*" is added.

#### ***Dative examples:***

*Be feltha a apit kigyo.* = *You give the tea to me.*

*Eti feltha sedeti etegyo.* *She gives them to him.*


### The Instrumental case:

The Instrumental case makes the word is changes the noun into what is being used to perform an action.

*Kin igyos gyadeto fanhoka = I drive to school by car.*

*Gyade = car/automobile.*

*Fanho = school (its in the allative case, don't worry.)*

If a word ends in a vowel, "*to*" is added.

If a word ends in a consonant, "*ot*" is added.

#### ***Instrumental examples:***

*Ko = question prefix added to the beginning of sentences making them into yes or no questions.*

*Vi/iv = future suffix for verbs.*

*Ko ben igyosiv gyadeto? = Will you go by car?*


### The Genitive case:

The Genitive case in Salvanian describe something as *belonging to x*. It can also turn nouns into adjectives like the colour yellow to yellow.

If a word ends in a vowel, "*co*" is added.

If a word ends in a consonant, "*oc*" is added.

#### ***Genitive examples:***

*Sen oda kico. = It isn't mine*

*Ag apin o kiaco. = The tea is good.*
